# GitHub Action Repo (Webhook Testing)

This is a dummy GitHub repo used to trigger webhook events (Push, Pull Request, Merge) for integration testing with a Flask webhook receiver.

### ðŸ”§ Actions Covered
- âœ… Push commits
- âœ… Create and merge pull requests
- âœ… Trigger GitHub webhooks using real events

### ðŸ§ª How it was used
1. Made dummy commits and pushed to main
2. Created a feature branch and opened a Pull Request
3. Merged the PR to main

All these events triggered the webhook to store data in MongoDB.
